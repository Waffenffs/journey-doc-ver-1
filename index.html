        <p>Hello. I am nearing the end of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification!</p>
        <p>You could say I'm a little bit proud of myself.</p>
        <p>I have had programming experience prior to this, but it was with Python and not with markup languages like HTML and CSS.</p>
        <p>It was a fun process, learning, googling, scratching my head in frustration..all of that.</p>
        <p>Why am I learning all of this at 16? It's to prepare myself for my future, and hold an edge over my future college classmates. </p>

          <p>Learning HTML/CSS was not too hard, but there are still things that makes me scratch my head in frustration.</p>
          <p>But I think that applies to everything nowadays, no?</p>
          <p>One thing I could say about my journey is that...it was fun. Learning new material is never not fun.</p>

          <p>I'll probably move on to learn JavaScript.</p>
          <p>It is one of the core skills a Web Developer should have..so It's probably a good idea to include it in your skillset.</p>
          <p> What's JavaScript without HTMl/CSS anyway?</p>
          <p>Currently, the things I'm planning to learn are: </p>
          <div class="script">
          <ul>
            <li class="learn">JavaScript</li>
            <li class="learn">React.js</li>
            <li class="learn">MongoDB</li>
          </ul>
          </div>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          <code></code>

          <p>It was a fun, challenging, thought-provoking journey that I know will benefit me in the future by providing an edge to me in college..probably. Who knows. There could be a guy in college who's been coding for way longer than me and knows more than me. That's how life goes.</p>
          <p>Anyways, I don't want to leave things on such a cynical note. It was fun. I highly encourage you to learn HTML/CSS, as it will provide you a very strong foundation that can help you in web dev.</p>
          <p>That's all, goodbye, and hae a great...day/night. I don't know!</p>
